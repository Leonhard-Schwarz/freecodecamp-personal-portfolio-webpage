# freecodecamp-personal-portfolio-webpage

This repository contains the code for my Personal Portfolio Webpage, which is part of the certification projects for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. The objective of this project is to build a functional product landing page similar to [https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks](https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks).

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a personal portfolio webpage that showcases my projects as a web developer.

The project will be built using HTML and CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing web page. The layout and design will be optimized for different screen sizes and devices to ensure a seamless user experience.
